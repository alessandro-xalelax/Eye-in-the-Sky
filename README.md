# Eye in the Sky

The goal of this project is to develop a Telegram Bot which would
allow me to control remotely a camera connected to a Raspberry Pi 
in my home. Moreover, the ability to read other sensors connected 
to the Pi would also be a useful feature for me.

A great source of inspiration for this project came from 
[home surveillance monitored via telegram](http://ginolhac.github.io/posts/diy-raspberry-monitored-via-telegram/),
kudos to Aur√©lien Ginolhac for the nice article on this.
